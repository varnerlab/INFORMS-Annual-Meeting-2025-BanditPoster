Good pulls yield higher rewards; poor pulls yield lower rewards (or even losses). The agent’s goal is to maximize cumulative reward over time.\n",

    "* __Clinical Trials__: Balances learning about new treatments (exploration) with assigning patients to the current best therapy (exploitation).\n",
    "* __Financial Portfolio Design__: Dynamically allocates capital across assets to maximize returns while testing novel investments.\n",
    "* __Adaptive Routing__: Chooses network paths to minimize delay, trading off probing unknown routes against using established fast ones.\n",

In this example, we'll explore bandit-based rebalancing strategies for a portfolio of risky assets. We'll reformulate the portfolio rebalancing problem as a multi-armed bandit problem, where each __asset combination__ represents an arm of the bandit. We'll implement an epsilon-greedy algorithm to decide when and how to rebalance the portfolio based on observed returns, and analyze the performance of this strategy in terms of cumulative returns and risk.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "In this lecture, we examined portfolio rebalancing strategies for maintaining optimal allocations in dynamic markets. We analyzed portfolio drift, introduced bandit algorithms for real-time portfolio decisions, and derived analytical solutions for utility-based asset allocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Key Takeaways:__\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * __Portfolio drift is inevitable without rebalancing:__ Asset weights naturally diverge from target allocations due to differing returns, causing unintended risk exposures. Continuous rebalancing is impractical due to transaction costs and taxes, necessitating strategic rebalancing policies.\n",
    "> * __Bandit algorithms balance exploration and exploitation:__ The epsilon-greedy algorithm provides a tractable approach to portfolio rebalancing decisions, allowing dynamic asset selection while managing the tradeoff between testing new asset combinations and committing to proven performers.\n",
    "> * __Utility maximization incorporates investor preferences:__ Cobb-Douglas utility functions combined with risk-adjusted single index model parameters enable systematic portfolio construction that reflects both asset fundamentals and individual investor risk tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next lecture, we will explore additional portfolio management techniques.\n",
